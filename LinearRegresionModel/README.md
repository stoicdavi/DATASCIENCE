# Accident Severity Analysis
### Project Overview
- This project aims to analyze the factors influencing accident severity using a dataset containing information about various accident characteristics.

## Dataset
- The dataset used for this analysis includes the following features:

- Speed: The speed of the vehicle involved in the accident.
- Weather: Weather conditions at the time of the accident.
- Road_Type: Type of road (e.g., highway, city street).
- Time_of_Day: Time of day when the accident occurred.
- Alcohol: Whether alcohol was involved in the accident.
- Driver_Age: Age of the driver.
- Vehicle_Type: Type of vehicle involved.
- Vehicles_Involved: Number of vehicles involved.
- Seatbelt: Whether the driver was wearing a seatbelt.
- Accident_Severity: The severity of the accident (target variable).
- Data Preparation and Analysis

## Data Loading and Exploration:

- Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
- Explore the data using descriptive statistics and visualizations.
- Handle missing values and outliers as necessary.
- Feature Engineering:

## Create new features or transform existing ones if needed.
- Consider encoding categorical variables using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.
## Model Selection and Training:

- Choose a suitable machine learning model, such as linear regression, decision trees, or random forest.
- Split the data into training and testing sets.
- Train the model on the training data.
# Model Evaluation:

- Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.
- Visualize the model's predictions and compare them with the actual values.
## Model Interpretation:
- Analyze the model's coefficients to understand the impact of each feature on accident severity.
  
# Future Work

- Explore advanced machine learning techniques like deep learning or ensemble methods.
- Incorporate additional features, such as road conditions or driver experience.
- Fine-tune the model's hyperparameters to improve performance.
- Deploy the model as a web application for real-time predictions.
# How it works
- Using jupyter notebook  # insall jupyter notebook
- install all the requirements
  - pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scilearn seaborn
- first clone this project
- git clone https://github.com/stoicdavi/DATASCIENCE.git
- cd DATASCIENCE/LinearRegresionModel
- to start the project
- run jupyter notebook # this is after making sure you are in the projects directory
- run all the cells to see
# How it works
- the is the outputs that you will get
